# HolidayTags

# ABOUT:
HolidayTags! started as a labor of love. Our Founder and CEO, thought of the concept during the holiday season at her first job out of 
college. She wanted to come up with a way to lift up the spirits of her team members by galvanizing everyone around the idea of 
thanksgiving and giving back. The first year her company's recruiting department made the cards -- their hands were sore throughout 
the week because the demand was so high they kept having to make more! The organization sold these for $2 each and the proceeds 
went to JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation). What she found time and time again of doing this though was that the 
desire to participate and Tag! someone was never short at any organization, but what was short was the time everyone had to write 
their notes, make the cards, and deliver them. So she came up with a way to eliminate the barriers and now schools and organizations 
are very easily ‘tagging’ each other across the nation. Why tag people? Because gratitude and championing a cause greater than yourself 
create a more productive team environment and better world. The team at Tag! Hopes to increase recognition not only in businesses, but in 
schools, families, and organizations across the globe!
